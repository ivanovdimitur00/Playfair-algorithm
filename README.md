## Description
The purpose and goal of the project is to create a program, demonstrating a cryptography algorithm. The topic of the Playfair Algorithm was chosen. 

The intended audiences are the teacher and assistant in my cryptographic methods class and myself.
<br/>
<br/>

## Key features and functionalities
* Plain text message and keyword input;
* Plain text message and keyword truncation. Option to see results;
* Encryption using the Playfair algorithm. Option to see result;
* Decryption using the Playfair algorithm. Option to see result;
* Visuals for the generation of the playfair matrix and bigraph substitution;
* Capability to restore truncated white spaces and some symbols.
<br/>

## Structutre
* The project is a Monolithic C++ file;
* There is documentation included inside the source, as well as some ideas.
<br/>

## Installation instructions
1. Access the source code from this repository and download it;
2. Using an IDE and/or a compiler for C++, compile for your computer system and launch the executable.
* NOTE: The options to see some results are present in the main() function.
<br/>

1. ALTERNATIVE: you can use [This online c++ compiler](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler) to compile and run the code. No extra settings or flags required.
<br/>

## DEPENDENCIES
* C++ compiler. OR
* internet connection
<br/>

## System requirements
| System Requirements |
| ------------------- |
| X86 capable CPU |
<br/>

## Usage examples
1. Input the message that you want to see truncated and encrypted;
2. Input the key that you want to be used in the encrypting process.
<br/>

## API references
Some functions that you need to know to edit the source code would be:
* If the project is used as a standalone library, describe the functions that can be called.


## Bugs
* describe any occuring bugs that need to be fixed


## Future improvements
* describe some ideas you would want to implement into your project
